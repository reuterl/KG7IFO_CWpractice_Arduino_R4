Source code for Arduino sketch.  Target platform is Arduino R4 Uno Wifi.  I chose thsi Arduino for the 12x8 LED matrix.  the dits and dahs for each keyed character are displayed on the matrix as they are entered.  Soon I'll check in a schematic and parts list for my hardware.  This software will interface a morse code key and speaker to simulate transmitting a QSO.  This requires my KG7IFO CW TRaine--Fist analyzer UI python script to see the key entries.
